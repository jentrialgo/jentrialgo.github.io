Recently, I’ve come across a few tools to understand GitHub repos better: [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/), [GitPodcast](https://www.gitpodcast.com/), and [ForGitHub](https://forgithub.com/).

### DeepWiki: Turning Repos into Interactive Documentation
DeepWiki, developed by Cognition Labs, automatically converts any GitHub repo into a comprehensive, wiki-style documentation with interactive visualizations. What I love most is its "in-depth research" feature—it provides insights that feel like they’re coming from a senior engineer, covering design concepts, best practices, and even optimization opportunities. You can check it out at [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/).

As an example, you can explore [DeepWiki for SimCT](https://deepwiki.com/asi-uniovi/simct/).

### GitPodcast: Listening to Code as a Story
GitPodcast converts any GitHub repository into an engaging podcast! Imagine listening to the evolution of a project, its commits, and its structure as a story while you’re on a walk or coding something else. It’s hosted by BandarLabs and available at [GitPodcast](https://www.gitpodcast.com/).

This is [the podcast for SimCT](https://www.gitpodcast.com/asi-uniovi/simct/).

### ForGitHub: Comparing Repos Side by Side

[ForGitHub](https://forgithub.com/) gives a list of cool tools and APIs that use the same URL structure as GitHub enabling you to use it by just changing your url, just like GitPostcast.
