From my previous post about [projects to test AI chat bots
locally](https://jentrialgo.github.io/projects-to-test-ai-chat-bots-locally.html#projects-to-test-ai-chat-bots-locally),
the field has not been standing still.

I've found that the easiest way to try LLMs locally is to use
[llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile): download a file, run it
 and that's it.

I've also tried [LM studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), which is more powerful, but
it's also more complicated to use.
