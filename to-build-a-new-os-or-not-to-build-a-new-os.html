    <h1>To build a new OS, or not to build a new OS?</h1>
<p>There's a fascinating debate in the software world about whether it still makes sense to create a new general-purpose operating system from scratch.</p>
<h3>The Pragmatic View</h3>
<p>On one side, you have figures like John Carmack. In a <a href="https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1961172409920491849">recent discussion on X</a>, he argued that building a new OS is often impractical. The cost, short lifespan, and developer burden rarely justify the effort, a lesson he learned from opposing Meta's custom XR OS.</p>
<h3>The Idealistic View</h3>
<p>On the other side is the spirit of the ultimate craftsman. This is captured perfectly in a joke by DHH during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcwzWzC7gUA&amp;t=3478s">this presentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"People who are really serious about software should make their own operating system."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's riffing on a famous quote by Alan Kay about hardware, but the message is clear: the ultimate challenge for a software purist is to build the whole stack.</p>
<h3>A Middle Ground: Omarchy</h3>
<p>Interestingly, DHH's own work offers a third path. He hasn't built an entirely new OS. Instead, he created <a href="https://omarchy.org/">Omarchy</a>, an "opinionated Arch + Hyprland Setup."</p>
<p>Omarchy is a customized version of Arch Linux, tailored for a keyboard-first, developer-focused workflow. It's a practical compromise: leveraging the stable foundation of Linux while building a bespoke user experience on top. It avoids reinventing the kernel but still achieves the goal of a perfectly tailored environment.</p>
<h3>The End of the OS Wars?</h3>
<p>This conversation raises a bigger question: have we reached the end of the line for general-purpose operating systems? For decades, the landscape has been dominated by two major families: <strong>Unix-likes</strong> (now primarily Linux and macOS) and <strong>Windows</strong>.</p>
<p>The sheer scale of these ecosystems is staggering. They have decades of development, vast hardware support, and millions of applications. For any newcomer to compete, they wouldn't just need a better kernel; they'd need to replicate this entire universe. The network effect is so strong that it creates an almost insurmountable barrier to entry.</p>
<p>I'm with Carmack on this one. The practical challenges of building a new OS are immense, and the likelihood of widespread adoption is slim. The only way I see this changing is if some hardware company decides to break the mold for new hardware, using a modern language (Rust?) and bridging the gap with existing ecosystems by using AI. But, even then, the odds are against them.</p>
